RTL design for our version of the Google Chrome "Dinosaur Game". Written in Verilog and implemented on a Nexys4 A7 FPGA board. Final project for USC's undergraduate digital circuit design class (EE 354L).

To synthesize/implement the project, create a new RTL project in Xilinx Vivado and add all the files in the source directory. Then generate the bitstream for the target device.
